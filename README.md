# Coding Quiz: Javascript

## Description

The motivation of this project was to develop a quiz on some basic javascript knowledge and give highscores based on a timer built into the quiz. I built this project to get better at javascript application and functionality. The problem this solves and also what I learned is that I know know how to set up parts of a quiz and build multiple screens from one document.

## Installation

I began with an HTML file that has very minimal information on it. After that I moved directly into Javascript for all of the functionality of the webpage. After getting to a point where i was satisfied with the quiz, i styled the webpage using CSS. After all of that was done and I had a final commit, I used github pages to deploy the webpage.
